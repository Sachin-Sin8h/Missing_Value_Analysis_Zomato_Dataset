# Missing_Value_Analysis_Zomato_Dataset
Missing value analysis on a large messy data through missingno package
The real-world data often has a lot of missing values. The cause of missing values can be data corruption or failure to record data. The handling of missing data is very important during the preprocessing stage of the data analysis as many machine learning algorithms do not support missing values. Zomato dataset is an appropriate dataset to get your hands dirty and learn the various techniques and methodology to analyse missing values and how to fix them. Through this notebook I have attempted to use some of the useful methods to analyse missing values in the data and apply required imputation techniques to fill them.
Steps followed in the analyis: (covered in the notebook)
1. Exploring the dataset
2. Cleaning the data
3. Missing value analysis (MAR/MNAR analsysis using missingno package)
4. Handling missing values (Required imputations)
5. EDA & visualizations
